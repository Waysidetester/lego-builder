## Purpose
This was all about calling json data asynchronously and saving modular selections to an array/object. This will later use a `POST` method when serving it to a database. I also implement SASS into this project.

## To View

1. Clone repository to local machine.
1. run the following command to download webpage dependencies: ```npm install```
1. open two terminals:

1. In terminal one run

* ```npm run json```

5. In terminal two run 

* ```npm start``` 

This should automatically open a new tab in your default browser.

## Notes

This uses SASS for styling. The only major note about it's use is that there is no special funcitonality. In other words, this could have been coded in a large css file. Future projects should see a heavier implementation of scss variables, nesting, etc.
